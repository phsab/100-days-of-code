**Thoughts:** Still dealing with the basics, I should be careful when going through theory: at some point things will be different from what I already know or just new stuff.

### Day 1: January 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for freecodecamp.org, started with the (oh so familiar) basics

**Thoughts:** Thanks Mathieu for point me out to this challenge.
