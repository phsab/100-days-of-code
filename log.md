# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 14: January 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with more in-depth focus on JS arrays, multi dimensional arrays and objects. It's all still high level. Definitely need more practicing. Looking for a good JS reference guide. Suggestions are welcome.

**Thoughts:** I need a good reference guide. I know I will need it when I start my own projects.

### Day 13: January 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Went totally nuts on arrays with push, pop, unshift, splice. Am I the only one mixing these methods every now and then?

**Thoughts:** Like I said: I keep messing up these methods!!!

### Day 12: January 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished JS regex. Went through some debugging lessons and learned about some common pitfalls. Played a little with console.log(), need to remember to use it more often.

**Thoughts:** console.log() is definitely an important feature. Need to remember that.

### Day 11: January 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked my way through JS regex. Learned some shorthands that might come in handy.

**Thoughts:** None.

### Day 10: January 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed ES6. Learned about constructor functions and importing/exporting stuff. Moved on to my favourite programming skills: regex! Discovered some nice tricks JS has in it's sleeve.

**Thoughts:** None.

### Day 9: January 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: ES6. Learned about destructuring assignments and variable assigments, learned som new shorthands too. 

**Thoughts:** Doesn't seem useful at the moment, but I will need real life cases to make it to good use.

### Day 8: January 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: ES6. Learned about arrow functions. I fear it will become one my pitfalls as it needs thorough reading.

I actually got lost at chapter _"Write Higher Order Arrow Functions"_ using the _filter()_ function. 

How the hell am I supposed to create this while being at beginner level:

```const squaredIntegers = arr.filter( (num) => num > 0 && num % parseInt(num) === 0 ).map( (num) => Math.pow(num, 2) );```

Another suprise at chapter _Use the Rest Operator with Function Parameters_: when solving the challenge I end up with one remark that introduces the _spread operator_ term, which was not discussed in the theory:

_The sum function uses the ... spread operator on the args parameter._

**Solution:** changed the variable name into `args`

**Thoughts:** Ok, this is getting more serious stuff.

### Day 7: January 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Yes! completed the basics of JS, tomorrow it's ES6 time.  

**Thoughts:** Should do this in the morning, not in the evening. 

### Day 6: January 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished the basics. Got lost a couple of times in understanding the questions and theory.  

**Thoughts:** The linguistic quality of some the questions could be better. 

### Day 5: January 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the basics. Not much new, merely the syntax differences need some extra attention.

**Thoughts:** -

### Day 4: January 8, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the basics. Not much new, merely the syntax differences need some extra attention.

**Thoughts:** Focus on time! :)

### Day 3: January 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Just passed the 50% of the JS basics. Again mixed up shifts and unshifts. Found some possible pitfalls regarding variable scopes.

**Thoughts:** No special thoughts today. Just enjoying it.

### Day 2: January 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the basics of JS @ freecodecamp.org and made it to 33% of the basics chapter. 

**Thoughts:** Still dealing with the basics, I should be careful when going through theory: at some point things will be different from what I already know or just new stuff.

### Day 1: January 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for freecodecamp.org, started with the (oh so familiar) basics

**Thoughts:** Thanks Mathieu for point me out to this challenge.
