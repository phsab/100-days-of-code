# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 42: February 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Studied some theory and practiced some excercises on the reduce() method. Very useful method, with a lot of options. Still suprised how often it can be applied to shorten code. However it doesn't make code easier to read...

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 41: February 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learned some new coding shortcuts. Still annoyed by some of my old skool coding habbits. Hard to get rid of them. Decided to give VCE a try, far more lightweight compared to Atom.

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 40: February 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Enjoyed some theory on new ES6 methods like every() and some(). Need to learn how to overcome this on older browsers though. Again the everlasting webdeveloper dilemma: browser versions!

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 39: February 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Rather busy, but found some time to work out some more exercises. I know little to report, but practice is necessary. 

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 38: February 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a JS execercise and spent about 15 minutes to find out why my code didn't work. Finally tested with a console.log, which didn't work either. Then I figured it out: I was working at the wrong live server... Anyway the code was ok. :) Need to continue coding a little more useless stuff for practise purposes. 

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 37: February 14, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Back to the theory of JS OOP. Purchased a video training by @moshhamedani who gives a very clear in-depth training. I think this training will take up entirely the remainder of this challenge. 

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 36: February 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Organized my coders notes. Got inspired by a couple of JS reference cards online. Decided to create my own in LaTeX. 

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 35: February 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Practiced my JS skills with some exercises. Goofed up some of the exercises by making my solutions too complex... Lesson learned: make a small reference card to help memorize some stuff.

**Thoughts:** Need to make some extra notes on theoretical stuff

### Day 34: February 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Practiced my JS skills with some exercises. Reviewed a couple of built-in object references at MDN which I needed for solving the exercises.

**Thoughts:** More exercises: https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercises.php

### Day 33: February 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: It's my review week! Worked out some of @moshhamedani's excersises. Feeling great because one of my solutions was cleaner and shorter than the master's. :) It looks like review week is rewarding itself: my JS coding skills are improving by the day.

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 32: February 8, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: It's my review week! Did a further review on my skills with some exercises from @moshhamedani's courses. I found out that taking a few steps back and then redo a coding course can be eye opening. I want to learn to code as good as possible not to learn as fast as possible to code.

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 31: February 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: It's my review week! Learned new skills to make my code cleaner and shorter. Feels odd to drop some of my coding habbits, but it looks much better and it improves readability! 

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 30: February 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: It's my review week! Found out things I didn't pay attention to before. Like the variable scope in control loops. So basic, but so easy to oversee! That will make my code much cleaner next time.

**Thoughts:** Mosh's videos finally make sense!

### Day 29: February 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: It's my review week! Still reviewing what I have learned so far. Refreshing theory of JS.

**Thoughts:** Mosh's videos finally make sense!

### Day 28: February 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued where I left of yesterday: reviewing what I have learned so far. Refreshing theory of JS.

**Thoughts:** Mosh's videos finally make sense!

### Day 27: February 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Based upon my experiences with the JS exercises of yesterday, I decided to do a full review of all the theory I learnt so far. Nice way of spending the first 3.5 hours of a Sunday morning! :)

**Thoughts:** Purchased 2 of Mosh's JS courses: Basics (yeah,... I know.... and OOP)

### Day 26: February 2, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Repeated the theory behind abstraction (getters and setters), but also the cloning and the scope of objects. Played with some related exercises. 

**Thoughts:** Mosh's video is perfect!

### Day 25: January 31, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Studied the theory behind primitives and objects more deeply. Worked out some JS examples and created my own versions. Slowly getting a grasp on it! 

**Thoughts:** Might decide to grab a training by Mosh. He's very good at his video instructions.

### Day 24: January 30, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Happy Birthday Mom! :) I've been working out some programming exercises on some other videos. Still haven't decided whether I should stick to the facturing or constructing function. I guess it's good to know them both, just in case a co-programmer is using the other one. 

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 23: January 29, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Added the Live Server package to my Atom environment and started to work out some JS examples from yesterday's video. Feeling like I'm doing useful stuff now. Need to feel more certain on this matter before moving to a framework.

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 22: January 28, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Watched a very useful instruction from @moshhamedani on OOP JS (https://youtu.be/PFmuCDHHpwk), things are much clearer now. And yes, JS OOP is not the same as Python OOP. I just have to forget these concepts when coding JS.

**Thoughts:** https://youtu.be/PFmuCDHHpwk

### Day 21: January 27, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished @freecodecamp JS OOP chapter. Not satisfied with their explanation on this subject, decided to continue with MDN and Scotch.io for this part of the coding challenge.

**Thoughts:** MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS

### Day 20: January 26, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Been scratching my head for a while on the OOP aspect of JS. I found out that it cannot be compared to regular OOP, well I figured... Need to find a better explanation than what @freecodecamp has.

**Thoughts:** Found something interesting on JS OOP: https://scotch.io/tutorials/object-oriented-programming-in-javascript

### Day 19: January 25, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with JS OOP. Got a headache because of poorly written OOP theory. Trying to visualize stuff on my whiteboard to create more sense... may be tomorrow better luck.

**Thoughts:** Need to review this chapter and find a better tutorial.

### Day 18: January 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JS OOP. Not too hard, just the typical difference in method names. Can't wait to dive into a little further.

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 17: January 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Been practicing some more JS coding. Unfortunately @freecodecamp is sometimes hard to follow: solutions to challenges that had not been discussed in the curriculum? Might have to check some other tutorials as well.

**Thoughts:** May be another source for getting through the theory?

### Day 16: January 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Had some interesting challenges in coding JS. Still need to read and understand the code better, though. 

**Thoughts:** I still need a good reference guide. Getting confused on using functions stuff like ()

### Day 15: January 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finally I got my hands on some JS coding exercises from @freecodecamp.org. Still looking for a clear JS reference guide to be used during exercises. Getting slowly my grip on JS, at last! :) 

**Thoughts:** I need a good reference guide. I need one now. Found one on MDN, but it's not as clear as the manual on PHP.net.

### Day 14: January 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with more in-depth focus on JS arrays, multi dimensional arrays and objects. It's all still high level. Definitely need more practicing. Looking for a good JS reference guide. Suggestions are welcome.

**Thoughts:** I need a good reference guide. I know I will need it when I start my own projects.

### Day 13: January 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Went totally nuts on arrays with push, pop, unshift, splice. Am I the only one mixing these methods every now and then?

**Thoughts:** Like I said: I keep messing up these methods!!!

### Day 12: January 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished JS regex. Went through some debugging lessons and learned about some common pitfalls. Played a little with console.log(), need to remember to use it more often.

**Thoughts:** console.log() is definitely an important feature. Need to remember that.

### Day 11: January 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked my way through JS regex. Learned some shorthands that might come in handy.

**Thoughts:** None.

### Day 10: January 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Completed ES6. Learned about constructor functions and importing/exporting stuff. Moved on to my favourite programming skills: regex! Discovered some nice tricks JS has in it's sleeve.

**Thoughts:** None.

### Day 9: January 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: ES6. Learned about destructuring assignments and variable assigments, learned som new shorthands too. 

**Thoughts:** Doesn't seem useful at the moment, but I will need real life cases to make it to good use.

### Day 8: January 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: ES6. Learned about arrow functions. I fear it will become one my pitfalls as it needs thorough reading.

I actually got lost at chapter _"Write Higher Order Arrow Functions"_ using the _filter()_ function. 

How the hell am I supposed to create this while being at beginner level:

```const squaredIntegers = arr.filter( (num) => num > 0 && num % parseInt(num) === 0 ).map( (num) => Math.pow(num, 2) );```

Another suprise at chapter _Use the Rest Operator with Function Parameters_: when solving the challenge I end up with one remark that introduces the _spread operator_ term, which was not discussed in the theory:

_The sum function uses the ... spread operator on the args parameter._

**Solution:** changed the variable name into `args`

**Thoughts:** Ok, this is getting more serious stuff.

### Day 7: January 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Yes! completed the basics of JS, tomorrow it's ES6 time.  

**Thoughts:** Should do this in the morning, not in the evening. 

### Day 6: January 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished the basics. Got lost a couple of times in understanding the questions and theory.  

**Thoughts:** The linguistic quality of some the questions could be better. 

### Day 5: January 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the basics. Not much new, merely the syntax differences need some extra attention.

**Thoughts:** -

### Day 4: January 8, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the basics. Not much new, merely the syntax differences need some extra attention.

**Thoughts:** Focus on time! :)

### Day 3: January 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Just passed the 50% of the JS basics. Again mixed up shifts and unshifts. Found some possible pitfalls regarding variable scopes.

**Thoughts:** No special thoughts today. Just enjoying it.

### Day 2: January 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the basics of JS @ freecodecamp.org and made it to 33% of the basics chapter. 

**Thoughts:** Still dealing with the basics, I should be careful when going through theory: at some point things will be different from what I already know or just new stuff.

### Day 1: January 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for freecodecamp.org, started with the (oh so familiar) basics

**Thoughts:** Thanks Mathieu for point me out to this challenge.
