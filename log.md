# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: January 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Just passed the 50% of the JS basics. Again mixed up shifts and unshifts. Found some possible pitfalls regarding variable scopes.

**Thoughts:** No special thoughts today. Just enjoying it.

### Day 2: January 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the basics of JS @ freecodecamp.org and made it to 33% of the basics chapter. 

**Thoughts:** Still dealing with the basics, I should be careful when going through theory: at some point things will be different from what I already know or just new stuff.

### Day 1: January 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for freecodecamp.org, started with the (oh so familiar) basics

**Thoughts:** Thanks Mathieu for point me out to this challenge.
