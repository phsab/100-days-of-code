# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 8: January 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: ES6. Learned about arrow functions. I fear it will become one my pitfalls as it needs thorough reading.
I actually got lost at chapter "Write Higher Order Arrow Functions" using the filter() function. How the hell am I supposed to create this while being at beginner level:
const squaredIntegers = arr.filter( (num) => num > 0 && num % parseInt(num) === 0 ).map( (num) => Math.pow(num, 2) );

**Thoughts:** Ok, this is getting more serious stuff.

### Day 7: January 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Yes! completed the basics of JS, tomorrow it's ES6 time.  

**Thoughts:** Should do this in the morning, not in the evening. 

### Day 6: January 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished the basics. Got lost a couple of times in understanding the questions and theory.  

**Thoughts:** The linguistic quality of some the questions could be better. 

### Day 5: January 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the basics. Not much new, merely the syntax differences need some extra attention.

**Thoughts:** -

### Day 4: January 8, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the basics. Not much new, merely the syntax differences need some extra attention.

**Thoughts:** Focus on time! :)

### Day 3: January 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Just passed the 50% of the JS basics. Again mixed up shifts and unshifts. Found some possible pitfalls regarding variable scopes.

**Thoughts:** No special thoughts today. Just enjoying it.

### Day 2: January 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the basics of JS @ freecodecamp.org and made it to 33% of the basics chapter. 

**Thoughts:** Still dealing with the basics, I should be careful when going through theory: at some point things will be different from what I already know or just new stuff.

### Day 1: January 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Signed up for freecodecamp.org, started with the (oh so familiar) basics

**Thoughts:** Thanks Mathieu for point me out to this challenge.
